This Repo, named JavaDSA, consists of Notes for Data Structures & Algorithms in JAVA along with some practice questions, some good questions of Leetcode or Codefores.

And I will also include previous year questions asked by different companies in there coding rounds

Topics of Practice Questions are as follows:
1. Patterns :  Comprises in deepth knowledge of Loops and Conditional

2. Arrays : data type arrays and usage of functions for many operations

3. Sorting Algorithms : sorting arrays through different types of sorting methods

4. 2D Arrays : creating a matrix, traversing a matrix and some questions on spiral matrix, diagonal sum and staircase search
